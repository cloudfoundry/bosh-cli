# Workpool

[![Go Report
Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/code.cloudfoundry.org/workpool)](https://goreportcard.com/report/code.cloudfoundry.org/workpool)
[![Go
Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/code.cloudfoundry.org/workpool.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/code.cloudfoundry.org/workpool)

Use a `WorkPool` to perform units of work concurrently at a maximum
rate. The worker goroutines will increase to the maximum number of
workers as work requires it, and gradually decrease to 0 if unused.

A `Throttler` performs a specified batch of work at a given maximum
rate, internally creating a `WorkPool` and then stopping it when done.
