*cyclonedx-go is a Go library to consume and produce CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)*

> If you just want to create BOMs for your Go projects, see [*cyclonedx-gomod*](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gomod)

## Installation

```
go get github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go
```

## Usage

Please refer to the module's [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go#section-documentation).  
Also, checkout the [`examples`](./example_test.go) to get an idea of how this library may be used.

## Compatibility

| cyclonedx-go versions | Supported Go versions | Supported CycloneDX spec |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|
|       < v0.4.0        |         1.14+         |           1.2            |
|       == v0.4.0       |         1.14+         |           1.3            |
|  >= v0.5.0, < v0.7.0  |         1.15+         |           1.4            |
|       >= v0.7.0       |         1.17+         |         1.0-1.4          |

We're aiming to support all [officially supported](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy) Go versions, plus
an additional older version.

Prior to v0.7.0, this library only supported the latest version of the CycloneDX specification. While it is generally 
possible to *read* BOMs of an older spec, *writing* would exclusively produce BOMs conforming to the latest supported spec.

Starting with v0.7.0, writing BOMs conforming to all previous version of the spec is also possible.

Pull requests are welcome. But please read the
[CycloneDX contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CycloneDX/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

It is generally expected that pull requests will include relevant tests. Tests are automatically run against all
supported Go versions (see [Compatibility](#compatibility)) for every pull request.

### Running Tests

Some tests make use of the [CycloneDX CLI](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli), e.g. to validate BOMs.  
Make sure to download the CLI binary and make it available as `cyclonedx` in your `$PATH`.  
This is done automatically for [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-go).
